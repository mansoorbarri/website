## My Linux Beginnings

My introduction to Linux began in 2020, during the lockdown period. I initially installed Kali Linux, driven by my interest in ethical hacking and my engagement with TryHackMe challenges. Due to resource constraints, a virtual machine wasn't feasible, and dual-booting became my only option.

While I appreciated Kali's capabilities, it struggled with everyday tasks like prolonged web browsing and video playback. Despite this, I used Kali as my primary operating system.

Subsequently, I switched to vanilla Debian, which became my stable workhorse. Debian's reliability was paramount to me; I prioritised a system that wouldn't require extensive troubleshooting before I could even check my emails.

## The Shift Towards Arch

However, Debian's conservative approach to software updates, particularly with applications like Chrome, started to become a concern. This led me to consider a more bleeding-edge distribution like Arch Linux. Initially, I dismissed the idea. However, when a newer version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) became available, but not for Debian, I decided to make the switch.

## Choosing an Arch-Based Distribution

I wasn't prepared for a full Arch Linux installation, so I opted for Manjaro. I wanted to experience the Arch ecosystem without the full complexity of a manual Arch install. Given my familiarity with Linux principles, I was confident in my ability to adapt to a new distribution's "syntax".

## Manjaro Experience

The initial weeks with Manjaro were challenging. The reliance on the Arch User Repository (AUR) and the constant warnings about its potential security risks were daunting. However, I discovered [Chris Titus's](https://christitus.com/) utility, similar to WinUtil for Windows, which simplified package management and system configuration. This was a significant relief.

## Three Months with Manjaro

After three months of using Manjaro as my primary operating system, I'm very satisfied. I appreciate the frequent updates and the availability of newer software versions.

This experience has broadened my Linux knowledge and encouraged me to explore beyond my comfort zone. It's a reminder to remain open to new approaches and avoid the rigid mindset sometimes seen in online communities.

2024 was unlike previous years. My focus shifted towards prioritising quality over quantity in the content I create, which is why my posts have been less frequent. Here's a look back at the year, highlighting things I‚Äôve stopped doing, things I‚Äôve started doing, and what I hope to achieve in 2025.

## Things I No Longer Do

### Newsletter  
In an effort to optimise my time, I became more critical about how I spend it. This meant letting go of certain activities and focusing on things I had either postponed for years or genuinely wanted to pursue.  

One notable decision was to stop publishing newsletters. Initially, I thought my perspective as a young adult navigating the tech world might resonate with an audience. However, despite several issues, sign-ups were non-existent. Writing each newsletter took around 40 minutes, as I strived to simplify topics for broader understanding.  

Over time, I realised the format wasn‚Äôt my strength, and the lack of engagement made it hard to justify the effort. Rather than produce mediocre work, I decided it was best to let this go.

### Gaming  
Believe it or not, I used to game a lot‚Äîwhether it was simulators, Minecraft, or mobile games. If I wasn‚Äôt studying, working, or out, I was likely gaming.  

That changed when I started college. My routine became packed, leaving little time for games. While I still dabble in gaming occasionally, it‚Äôs no longer the focus it once was. Surprisingly, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this new balance a bit more.

## Things I Have Started Doing

### Time Blocking  
One of the most impactful changes this year has been adopting time blocking. I now allocate specific blocks of time to focus on a single task. While I don‚Äôt always stick to the schedule rigidly, I follow it more often than not.  

The rule I live by: *‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not on the calendar, I‚Äôm not doing it.‚Äù* This approach has simplified decision-making and improved how I manage my day. It‚Äôs been transformative, and I genuinely feel better for it.

### Full Stack Development  
In 2023, I was immersed in hacking, scripting, and Linux. This year, I‚Äôve shifted towards web development, especially full stack. I‚Äôve worked on several projects and found the process incredibly rewarding.  

While one of my projects didn‚Äôt pan out as expected, the experience was invaluable. You can read more about it [here](/why-i-left-startup-journey/). Looking ahead, I plan to dive deeper into this field and take on more ambitious challenges.

## What I Want to Do in 2025  

With much of the foundational learning done, I‚Äôm ready to build something meaningful‚Äîsomething people genuinely need or something I personally find valuable. As of now, I don‚Äôt have a specific idea, but I‚Äôm excited to see where the journey takes me. üëÄ  

2024 has been a year of recalibration. By focusing on what matters most, I‚Äôve set the stage for a purposeful and productive 2025.

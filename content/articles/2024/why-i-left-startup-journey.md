## Act One: The Opportunity 
The story begins when I was approached for a freelance gig to build a custom clinic management system. The client was using a non-bespoke system that lacked critical features and, more importantly, did not provide them with their own database—a glaring limitation in today’s data-driven world. While their existing system’s operations were a story in itself, they needed a solution tailored to their specific needs. After discussing the project, I was hired to develop the system from scratch.

With enthusiasm, I presented a detailed plan, which the client approved without hesitation. It was exciting to work on a project that had the potential to address a significant gap in the market. However, the excitement was short-lived. Not long into development, the client informed me that financial difficulties meant they could no longer proceed. Although disheartening, I realised there was still potential in this project. My research revealed that 80–90% of clinics and pharmacies in the region relied on the same outdated management system. Sensing an opportunity, I decided to transform the project into my own product, filling a much-needed market gap.

## Act Two: The Hustle
Determined to turn the idea into reality, I set out to build the clinic management system from scratch. Although my backend skills were solid, I knew the project required more. I dedicated myself to improving my skills and learning frontend development to meet the challenges ahead. To streamline the process, I collaborated with a talented friend, Maheen Waris, who brought her frontend expertise to the table and played a pivotal role in the project. (You can check her work [here.](https://maheenwaris.com/))

As the development progressed, the system started to take shape. After months of hard work, the project was about 70% complete, and I began planning for the launch. However, challenges loomed large on the horizon. Compliance issues with government regulations surfaced, requiring time and energy I didn’t have. Furthermore, managing servers and databases presented financial hurdles I couldn’t overcome alone. Another issue was the cultural resistance in Pakistan—many clinic owners were reluctant to adopt new technology, and without the client’s support, gaining initial traction seemed near impossible.

## Act Three: The Setback
Faced with these challenges, I had to make a tough decision. Realising I lacked the resources to launch the system successfully at that moment, I chose to archive the project. It wasn’t an easy choice, but it was the practical one. Although I put the project on hold, I haven’t abandoned it entirely. The vision of creating a bespoke clinic management system tailored for under-served clinics and pharmacies still excites me, and I hope to revisit it in the future. For now, I’ve moved on to other ventures, but the lessons learned from this journey have left a lasting impact.

This experience taught me the importance of resilience, adaptability, and recognising when to pivot. While the project remains a work in progress, it has the potential to transform how clinics in Pakistan and beyond manage their operations. Perhaps one day, it will make its way off the shelf and into the hands of those who need it most.
